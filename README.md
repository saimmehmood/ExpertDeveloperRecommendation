# ExpertDeveloperRecommendation
A tool designed to work as a search engine to find expert developers based on their skills and experience.

## Overview


## Abstract
Global and distributed software development increases the need to find developers with relevant expertise. At
the same time, online collaborative development tools such as GitHub have become extremely popular and are publicly
providing considerably large datasets on projects and developers. Currently, a variety of algorithms, methodologies and techniques
exists on using collaborative data to recommend expert developers based on knowledge and other criteria. We worked to
adapt as well as extend several of these methods so as to better match the large size of available datasets. Specifically, we created
a tool that can be used as a search engine for expert developers, based on their skills and experience, which are extracted based
on their actual code contributions.
